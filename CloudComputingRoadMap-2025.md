### 🔰 Phase 1: Understanding the Basics (Weeks 1–4)

**Goal:** Grasp foundational cloud concepts and deploy your first cloud resource.

#### 📚 What to Learn:

* What is cloud computing?
* Benefits of using the cloud
* Service models: IaaS, PaaS, SaaS
* Deployment models: Public, Private, Hybrid
* Key providers: AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud (GCP)

#### 🧠 Why it matters:

Understanding these basics builds your mental model of the cloud and prepares you to use it practically.

#### 💻 Hands-on:

* Create a free-tier account on **AWS**, **Azure**, or **GCP**
* Launch your first **virtual machine (VM)** on the platform
* Explore the cloud console and dashboards

#### 🕒 Weekly Time: 4–6 hours

> Suggested: 2 hours reading + 2 hours watching tutorials + 1–2 hours hands-on

---

### 🛠️ Phase 2: Core Services (Weeks 5–8)

**Goal:** Learn to use essential cloud services like storage, compute, and networking.

#### 📚 What to Learn:

* Compute: EC2 (AWS), Azure VM, GCP Compute Engine
* Storage: S3, Azure Blob Storage, GCP Cloud Storage
* Networking: VPC, Subnets, IPs, Security Groups
* Databases: RDS, Azure SQL, GCP Cloud SQL
* Identity and Access Management (IAM)

#### 💻 Hands-on:

* Deploy a web server using EC2/VM
* Upload/download files from cloud storage
* Set up a virtual private network (VPC)
* Create IAM users with restricted permissions
* Connect to a managed database and insert data

#### 🕒 Weekly Time: 5–7 hours

> Suggested: 2–3 hours reading & watching, 2–4 hours labs

---

### ⚙️ Phase 3: Going Beyond (Weeks 9–12)

**Goal:** Learn about modern cloud practices—serverless, infrastructure as code, and monitoring.

#### 📚 What to Learn:

* **Serverless computing**: AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, GCP Functions
* **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Terraform or ARM/Bicep
* **Monitoring and Logging**: CloudWatch, Azure Monitor, Stackdriver
* **Cloud billing** and cost calculators

#### 💻 Hands-on:

* Write a serverless function that triggers on an event (e.g., HTTP request)
* Use Terraform to deploy a VM or storage bucket
* View system metrics and set up a basic alert
* Estimate costs of a small cloud architecture

#### 🕒 Weekly Time: 6–8 hours

> Suggested: 3 hours reading, 3–4 hours hands-on labs/projects

---

### 🎯 Phase 4: Practice & Certification (Weeks 13–16)

**Goal:** Apply what you’ve learned in a mini-project and prepare for a beginner certification.

#### 📚 What to Learn:

* Review of all prior topics
* Certification-specific preparation

  * **AWS Cloud Practitioner**
  * **Azure AZ-900**
  * **Google Cloud Digital Leader**

#### 💻 Final Project Ideas:

* Host a static website with a backend API (e.g., contact form)
* Deploy a 2-tier app: frontend on EC2/Azure App Service + DB on RDS/Azure SQL
* Use IaC to define all infrastructure
* Set up basic monitoring & cost alerts

#### 🕒 Weekly Time: 6–10 hours

> Suggested: 2 hours reading, 3 hours hands-on, 1–2 hours certification practice tests

| AZ-900                      | Microsoft Azure | \$99                          | High demand in enterprise jobs |
| Google Cloud Digital Leader | GCP             | \$99                          | Great for GCP exploration      |

---

### 🛠 Tools to Explore Along the Way

* **CLI Tools**: AWS CLI, Azure CLI, Google `gcloud`
* **IaC**: Terraform, ARM Templates, Bicep
* **Version Control**: Git + GitHub
* **Cloud Calculators**: AWS, Azure, and GCP pricing calculators
* **Free Labs**: AWS Skill Builder, Microsoft Learn, Qwiklabs

---

### 🧠 Tips for Success

* 💡 **Stay consistent**: Even 1 hour/day can produce big results over 4 months.
* 🧪 **Hands-on is key**: Watching videos is great, but building things cements your knowledge.
* 🤝 **Join a community**: Reddit, Discord servers, or LinkedIn groups can help you stay motivated.
* 📘 **Document your journey**: Blog or note your progress—great for review and resume-building.
